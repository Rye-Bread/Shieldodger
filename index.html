<h2>Thanks to phaser states, I don't have a playable game. You can still RACE yourself though.</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Well phaser is jack shit for helping you learn it, or being documented well, so I spent a good while trying to make anything work with states. It didn't pan out. TL;DR: I'm pissed off at a variety of things and bitch frequently about them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience? Literally all I have is a guy that walks around in a room, and even collision maps didn't work, because phaser is shitty at telling you what went wrong.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Walk around simulator.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Arrow keys to walk around. That's it. Anything else constantly crashed everything. THUS, enjoy, RACING around the room. See, you can still race and shit so it fufills the requirements. At least the music's good.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Well, originally, and it would be done if phaser wasn't absolutely awful for anyone that doesn't know entirely what the hell they're doing, a fun game where you are a player, being chased by an orb. The orb would get faster as time goes on, until you die. If it had gone even better than that, I would have had more orbs spawn if you lived long enough. But, clearly, none of that happened because all this is about as intuitive as a building made out of bricks and shit.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is room, and you are character. There's this mysterious orb in the middle of the room that doesn't do anything, because including anything resulted in crashes with no feedback as to why it was occuring. There is an arrow, too, that you may think have been purposed to help the orb kill you, but that shit fell flat on its face because you are the hero and its creator didn't bother to hide this atrocity.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
YOU ARE CHARACTER, YOU HAIL FROM ROOM. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ROOM, AND ONLY ROOM. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ORB, AND WEIRD UNHID ARROW THAT POINTS AT YOU. You are not sure what a phaser state is, but you're pretty sure it was coded by monkeys and is likely retarded, breaking the entire fabric of space and time.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The human demographic.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Forever. You can never quit. You can never leave. Escape is futile. You will experience my frustration forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Walk around, listen to the music. There's nothing else. You can count on my future games likely not including phaser states so that I can actually have game content in them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Well because I was taught jack shit about phaser and javascript, given very little time to teach myself, and additionally the phaser educational resources being an awful pile of gorilla shit themselves, you have the result: this pile of shit. Code was taken from various parts of phaser examples because there's little to no innate understanding of what anything does, a substantial part of computer science itself. Perhaps the only reason I'm annoyed is because the self-teaching wasn't forthcoming. A lot of the pictures I drew myself, music is by Chris Karsch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrows from project template basic for phaser states. You walk around because PHASER DOESN'T HELP YOU FOR SHIT MATE. Don't want a handhold just some gorram feedback and properly documented website detailing with actual,decent, explanations of what all the shit does. Being that it touts itself as easy to get into, it shouldn't require a genius, yeah? Yeah, maybe they could also remove the GIANT ASININE BAR FROM THEIR WEBSITE THAT COVERS UP MOST OF THE WEBPAGE. Wow, I can't believe you got through my incessant nattering and complaints! Congradulations, you win the game, or something; unless you were thinking about The Game, in which case you lost.
